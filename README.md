# About Me

>>“Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before” - Vonnegut? Who remembers. 

New Jersey native currently living in Baltimore with my wife and pet cactus. I recently graduated from medical school and I enjoy learning about medicine, psychiatry, and data science (buzzwords!). 

In my spare time I enjoy purchasing golf equipment that I don’t need, choosing the longest lines at the ski lift, and finding increasingly involved ways to make coffee.
