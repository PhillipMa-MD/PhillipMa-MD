# About Me

New Jersey native currently living in New Jersey with my wife, son and pet cactus. I enjoy learning about medicine, psychiatry, and data science (buzzwords!). 

In my spare time I enjoy purchasing :golfing: golf clubs that I don’t need, choosing the longest lines at the :skier: ski lift, and finding increasingly involved ways to make :coffee: coffee.
